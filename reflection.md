Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

What are your initial impressions of how `Unit Testing` affects your programming?

JJ: It's helped me understand how the code works, better because I have to think about how to make a test for the portion of code and that allows me to think about what I expect from that block of code and what methods of testing would work for that scenario. It also helped me edit the code from A4 using both the testing and the feedback from the graded assignment. What didn't work was when I was doing the first test for the passenger class because I couldn't figure out how to define the method for the type car. I like testing more than the orginal assignment. 


Nazifa: Unit Testing definitley helps break down the code and test each individual action that I am trying to do. It helped me also break down what exactly I am expecting the train or any class within it to do versus what it is actually doing. I think it was a little confusing to grasp at first with all the assert statements since the code looked different than what I was used to but when I did understand it, it was much simpler. 





What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

JJ: making sure that the tests for the same class had the same intializations worked well because that made the next test 1 step less. utlizing the slides from class helped and I think that students in the future should utlize that outside of office hours. work with smaller numbers when testing or initially coding. 

Nazifa: What worked was making the tests for the passenger and the first few classes. However, the train class was definitely more dificult especially printManifest because it required you to check the output in the console so that took a bit of trial and error until I was able to execute the test correctly. The advice I give to someone taking the course is to go over everything slowly and break it down so that it doesn't feel like a lot at once. There are things that you learn along the way while coding and that's okay/completely normal don't ever think it means that you aren't smart enough.
