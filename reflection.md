Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

What are your initial impressions of how `Unit Testing` affects your programming?

JJ: It's helped me understand how the code works, better because I have to think about how to make a test for the portion of code and that allows me to think about what I expect from that block of code and what methods of testing would work for that scenario. It also helped me edit the code from A4 using both the testing and the feedback from the graded assignment. What didn't work was when I was doing the first test for the passenger class because I couldn't figure out how to define the method for the type car. I like testing more than the orginal assignment.

What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

JJ: making sure that the tests for the same class had the same intializations worked well because that made the next test 1 step less. utlizing the slides from class helped and I think that students in the future should utlize that outside of office hours. work with smaller numbers when testing or initially coding.
